The study, which was conducted on 84 patients, used advanced imaging techniques to examine the structure and function of the brain.\n\nThe researchers found that Covid-19 patients had reduced gray matter density in several areas of the brain, including the hippocampus, which is important for memory and learning. They also found that patients had decreased connectivity between different regions of the brain, which could affect cognitive function.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Maria T. Gravani, said that the findings were significant because they suggest that Covid-19 may have long-term effects on the brain, even in people who have mild or no symptoms.
