A spinel-type LiMn2O4 material was first prepared by hard-templating pathway using KIT-6 mesoporous silica as a template and metal nitrates as precursors, which was subsequently acid treated leading to λ-MnO2 material. The materials exhibit high surface area (up to 150 m2 g−1), defined pore size distribution with three-dimensional interconnected pores, and crystalline pore walls. The material textural properties as well as the morphologies vary considerably with the synthetic conditions. The as-synthesized porous λ-MnO2 materials exhibit a noticeably better performance (120 F g−1) at high constant currents (1 A g−1) than commercial derived λ-MnO2 (11 F g−1). The extended surface area and the porous and three-dimensional interconnected structures along with the specific morphology significantly enhance the lithium diffusion through the particles and allow for a more effective use of this pseudocapacitive material as an electrode in supercapacitor.",

We reviewed cases of allergic contact dermatitis to cosmetics diagnosed in our dermatology department over a 7-year period with a view to identifying the allergens responsible, the frequency of occurrence of these allergens, and the cosmetic products implicated. Methods Using the database of the skin allergy department, we undertook a search of all cases of allergic contact dermatitis to cosmetics diagnosed in our department from January 2000 through October 2007. Results In this period, patch tests were carried out on 2485 patients, of whom 740 were diagnosed with allergic contact dermatitis and the cause was cosmetics in 202 of these patients (170 women and 32 men), who accounted for 27.3% of all cases. A total of 315 positive results were found for 46 different allergens. Allergens most often responsible for contact dermatitis in a cosmetics user were methylisothiazolinone (19%), paraphenylenediamine (15.2%), and fragrance mixtures (7.8%). Acrylates were the most common allergens in cases of occupational disease. Half of the positive results were obtained with the standard battery of the Spanish Group for Research Into Dermatitis and Skin Allergies (GEIDAC). The cosmetic products most often implicated among cosmetics users were hair dyes (18.5%), gels/soaps (15.7%), and moisturizing creams (12.7%). Conclusion Most patients affected were women. Preservatives, paraphenylenediamine, and fragrances were the most frequently detected cosmetic allergens, in line with previous reports in the literature. Finally, in order to detect new cosmetic allergens, cooperation between physicians and cosmetics producers is needed.",

The potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance measurements show that addition of 0.4wt% Mn can decrease the passive current density of Zn in the passive region. XPS surface analysis indicates that there is approximately 1.0–2.0at% Mn2+ being incorporated into the passive film on Zn–0.4Mn alloy with Mn content being higher in the outer layers. Mott–Schottky analysis shows that the incorporated Mn can decrease concentration of defects in the film. AFM observations disclose that Mn can decrease the grain size of the film. The mechanism by which Mn additions improve the passivity of Zn is that the incorporated Mn can inhibit ions transportation in the film and inhibit its growth. Meanwhile, Mn can also promote the nucleation of Zn oxides and decrease film porosity.",

Four distinct regions of behaviour were identified, namely active corrosion, the active–passive transition, passive region and the dielectric breakdown region. The active corrosion and active–passive transition were characterized by anodic peak current (i m) and voltage (E m), which in turn were found to vary with the experimental conditions, i.e., d ( log ⁡ ( i m ) ) / dpH = − 0.8 ± 0.1 and dE m/dpH which was −71mV at 98°C, −58mV at 80°C and −28mV at 60°C. The activation energy for titanium corrosion, determined from temperature studies, was found to be 67.7kJmol−1 in 0.1M H2SO4 and 56.7kJmol−1 in 1.0M H2SO4. The dielectric breakdown voltage (E d) of the passive TiO2 film was found to vary depending on how much TiO2 was present. The inclusion of Mn2+ into the H2SO4 electrolyte, as is done during the commercial electrodeposition of manganese dioxide, resulted in a decrease in titanium corrosion current, possibly due to Mn2+ adsorption limiting electrolyte access to the substrate.",

However, efforts to achieve uniform Li plating and stripping in conventional liquid electrolytes have had limited success. An alternative approach is to use a solid electrolyte to stabilize the Li interface during cycling. One of the most promising solid electrolytes is Li7La3Zr2O12, which has high ionic conductivity at room temperature, high shear modulus and chemical and electrochemical stability against Li. Despite these properties, Li filament propagation has been observed through LLZO at current densities below what is practical. By combining recent achievements in reducing interface resistance and optimizing microstructure, we demonstrate Li cycling at current densities competitive with Li-ion. Li|LLZO|Li cells are capable of cycling at up to 0.9 ± 0.7 mA cm−2, 3.8 ± 0.9 mA cm−2, and 6.0 ± 0.7 mA cm-2 at room temperature, 40 and 60 °C, respectively. Extended stability is shown in Li plating/stripping tests that passed 3 mAh cm−2 charge per cycle for a cumulative capacity of 702 mAh cm−2 using a 1 mA cm−2 current density.

Background: Cannabis abuse is thought to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia. However several studies have examined the influence of current cannabis abuse on illness characteristics, little is known about the antecedents of pre-psychotic cannabis abuse in patients with psychosis and its effects on the clinical picture of the subsequent illness. In this study we aimed to examine in a sample of patients already diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, the predictors and consequences of: (1) pre-psychotic cannabis abuse, (2) early cannabis abuse and (3) current cannabis abuse. Methods: Pre-psychotic characteristics included sociodemographic variables, childhood and adolescence adjustment. Phenotypic measures included age of illness onset, psychopathology (OPCRIT) and a short neuropsychological battery. These characteristics were then compared according to patients' pre-psychotic and current history of cannabis abuse. Results: A sample of 337 patients with psychosis was included. It was found that pre-psychotic cannabis abuse was associated with better social but worse school premorbid adjustment. Early cannabis abuse predicted an earlier age of illness onset and more negative and cognitive symptoms. Finally, current cannabis abuse was associated with more severe positive, manic and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: While psychotic patients who comorbidly abuse cannabis may have more prominent positive and affective symptoms, those who started abusing cannabis during their early adolescence have poor adolescent school adjustment, early onset of illness and more prominent negative symptoms and cognitive abnormalities.",

In addition to separating the positive and negative electrodes, they provide a constant pressure on the active materials thereby reducing the rate of degradation during cycling. Dendrites formed from the negative active material are also less likely to cause short circuits in batteries where a separator is employed. The level to which a separator will influence the performance of a VRLA battery it strongly dependent on its properties. This paper describes the results from a series of tests used to characterise the properties of separators most influential to battery performance. These properties include, the macroscopic structure, permittivity and wicking rates. During the operational life of a VRLA battery the volume of electrolyte will decrease, due mainly to the electrolysis of water during overcharging. The consequence of this process is a variation of acid saturation during the life of the battery, which will have a direct influence on the compressive and diffusive properties of the separator. Compressive and diffusive characteristics were therefore measured over a range of saturation levels. Characterisation was conducted on three separator types. Types A and B were 100% glass but had slightly different structures and type C contained 8% polyester fibres mixed with glass.",

Il s’agit de l’étalonnage, auprès d’enfants de 3 à 8ans, du test de batterie de décision visuelle d’objets (BDVO), portant sur les gnosies visuelles ou, plus précisément, sur une étape du traitement de l’image qui concerne plus particulièrement les orthoptistes : le stock structural (ou stock en mémoire pour les formes connues). Dans le modèle séquentiel du traitement de l’image, il se situe au niveau de l’étape cognitive qui succède aux étapes sensorielle et perceptive explorées par le bilan orthoptique. Ce test, rapide à faire passer, s’avère être un bon outil d’investigation, mais également un moyen de transmission des données recueillies. L’objectif est de favoriser la coordination des soins thérapeutiques et/ou palliatifs ; de mieux comprendre l’enfant, son refus de regarder, son comportement insolite, parfois inquiétant pour son entourage.",

Today, learning-teaching theories emphasize ‘learning’ so distance education has been affected and ‘distance learning’ concept has begun widely used. Distance learning has included different emerging media such as computer, intranet and internet because of rapid change and widespread use of technology. Electronic learning environments allow learners to access information from anywhere and anytime. Nowadays, this change means accessing information from everywhere and every time with become widely available of mobile devices. As the results of these changes, we need to blend various learning environments to design the future of distance learning in which learners can decide what to learn, where and how to learn in respect of their request and individual differences.",

The electrochemical reaction with lithium of the manganese carbonate leads to the formation of the manganese metal and lithium carbonate as the main side product, which yields higher capacity than graphite and good capacity retention.

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy studies revealed formation of a film with needle-like Na4Mn9O18 homogeneously distributed and anchored on the RGO matrix. A sodium rechargeable hybrid aqueous battery with this novel cathode and zinc anode was first investigated and reported. The NMO-RGO film delivered a reversible discharge capacity of about 83 mAh g−1 when cycled galvanostatically at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, which was for about 78% higher than that of Na4Mn9O18 prepared by a slurry casting technique. This significant enhancement of electrochemical properties of NMO-RGO was due to the presence of graphene sheets in this free-standing composite cathode. These sheets form an agile substrate with a high conductivity to guarantee a successive electronic conduction channels in the electrode. In the same time, such composition and structure enables accommodation of the volume changes of Na4Mn9O18 during sodium insertion-extraction.",

In this direction, Ni(OH)2 has been prepared using the co-precipitation method by varying the concentrations of zinc additive (2, 4, 6 & 8wt%) and pH (8, 9, 10 & 11). The results show that the prepared samples exist in β-phase with flake like structure. The electrochemical properties of b-Ni(OH)2 have been investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements using a paste-type electrode on a nickel mesh as a current collector. The cyclic voltammetry measurements indicate that the reversibility of the electrode reaction increases at pH 10 and 6% Zn additive. Whereas, the EIS measurements reveal that a reduction in the charge transfer resistance increases the double layer capacitance of the nickel electrode.",

The prepared Ni(OH)2 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 112 Fg-1 at a current density of 1 Ag-1, which is comparable to the reported values in the literature.

Prototypes of the enhanced harvester are constructed and characterized experimentally. Nonlinear dynamical models of the harvester are developed and validated against experimental data. Additionally, prototypes of the commonly studied magnetic spring based energy harvesters are constructed, characterized, and modeled. Results show excellent agreement between model simulations and experimental data. Results show that the enhanced harvester significantly outperforms the commonly studied magnetic spring based vibration energy harvesters, especially at low acceleration levels. The enhanced harvester generates 1.97 [mW/cm3 g2] at 0.4 g [m/s2] which is approximately 400% the amount of power generated by the traditional magnetic spring based harvester, i.e. 0.5 [mW/cm3 g2]. Additionally, the half-power frequency bandwidth of the enhanced harvester is 90% wider compared to the traditional harvester. At lower acceleration, i.e. 0.1 g [m/s2], the enhanced harvester exhibits 4000% increase in power metrics compared to the traditional harvester. This makes the presented enhanced harvester design exceptionally suitable for applications where low acceleration oscillations are abundant including harvesting vibrations from highway bridges and human body motion.",

Due to their high complexity, a good understanding of blended electrodes is still lacking, including their electrolyte/electrode interfacial kinetics, which is a key factor for determining battery service life, safety, and power performance. In this paper, a comprehensive study of the interfacial impedance in Si-alloy/graphite blended electrodes is presented through experiment and theory. Experiments were conducted by the characterization of symmetric cells by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. An inhomogeneous transmission line model (ITLM) was developed to investigate this binary system on a large scale. Both experimental and theoretical results show that adding a small proportion of low interfacial impedance particles can suppress interfacial impedance growth in blended electrodes.",

A model might be very useful, which describes all contributions to the internal cell resistance, enables an optimization of the cell design, and calculates the performance of an open choice of cell architectures. A newly developed one-dimensional model for ASSBs is presented, based on a design concept which employs the use of composite electrodes. The internal cell resistance is calculated by linking two-phase transmission line models representing the composite electrodes with an ohmic resistance representing the solid electrolyte (separator). Thereby, electrical parameters, i.e. ionic and electronic conductivity, electrochemical parameters, i.e. charge-transfer resistance at interfaces and lithium solid-state diffusion, and microstructure parameters, i.e. electrode thickness, particle size, interface area, phase composition and tortuosity, are considered as the most important material and design parameters. Subsequently, discharge curves are simulated, and energy- and power-density characteristics of all-solid-state cell architectures are calculated.

It is shown that the concentration of lithium perchlorate in sulfolane considerably affects the depth of electrochemical reduction of sulfur, the reactivity of lithium polysulfides, and the coulomb efficiency of cycling of lithium-sulfur cells. The maximum depth of electrochemical reduction of sulfur is reached at the concentration of lithium perchlorate in sulfolane of 1.0M, while the minimum depth is reached at 2.8М. The depth of electrochemical reduction of sulfur is limited by the number of free solvent molecules. An increase in the concentration of the support salt results in an increase in the coulomb efficiency of cycling of lithium-sulfur cells. At concentrations of the support salt above 2.4М, the coulomb efficiency of cycling of lithium-sulfur cells is close to 100%. We believe that the concentration of support salts affects the species of lithium polysulfides, their association-dissociation equilibria in electrolyte solutions and the processes of solvation of lithium ions contained in lithium polysulfides and support salts, and thus determines the performance of lithium-sulfur cells.",

Direct tests of blood alcohol concentrations are considered the most accurate, desktop stationary breath testers based on electro-chemical infra-red technology are slightly less accurate, but accepted for evidentiary purposes in most jurisdictions, and quick portable breath testers based on fuel-cell technology are the easiest to administer but not acceptable in many courts. This study compared the accuracy of an evidentiary portable breath tester and an evidentiary desktop breath tester relative to blood alcohol concentrations. Inverse regressions were used to obtain confidence limits for the alcohol levels as read by the breath testers that would provide tradeoffs of false positives and false negatives for three levels of confidence: 95%, 96%, and 98%; corresponding to false positive values of 2.5%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. A decision tree model is offered for the optimal use of the three measures, so that portable breath testers can be sufficient for high level BrAC, stationary breath testers can be sufficient for medium level BrAC, and blood tests are recommended for still lower BrACs. The model provides quantitative BrAC threshold levels for the two most common BAC levels used to imply DWI: 50mg/dl and 80mg/dl.",

The experimental results indicate that MC/Co3O4-FC has bio-mesopores structure and the sizes of pores are between 3.0 nm and 6.5 nm. In addition, the specific surface area of MC/Co3O4-FC is 122.4 m2 g−1. As an anode material, the MC/Co3O4-FC shows a reversible capacity of 528.1 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 200 cycles, about twice as well as MC (~262 mAh g−1). Even at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1, the discharge capacity of MC/Co3O4-FC also can reach to 260 mAh g−1. The good electrochemical performances can be imputed to the bio-mesopores structure and synergistic effect between MC and Co3O4 particles.

However, breast milk may be contaminated by environmental neurotoxicants, such as methylmercury. In the Faroe Islands, where maternal consumption of pilot whale may cause transfer of marine toxicants into breast milk, a cohort of 1022 consecutive singleton births was generated during 1986–87. Methylmercury exposure was assessed from mercury concentrations in cord blood and in the hair of the child at age 12 months, and the duration of breastfeeding was recorded. At approximately 7 years of age, 917 (90%) of the children underwent detailed neurobehavioral examination. After adjustment for confounders, breastfeeding was associated with only marginally better neuropsychological performance on most tests. These associations were robust even after adjustment for cord-blood and hair mercury concentration at age 1 year. Thus, in this cohort of children with a relatively high prenatal toxicant exposure and potential exposure to neurotoxicants through breast milk, breastfeeding was associated with less benefits on neurobehavioral development than previously published studies though not associated with a deficit in neuropsychological performance at age 7. Although the advantage may be less, Faroese women can still safely breastfeed their children.\r\n",

Among clock genes, Period3 (PER3) has been associated with circadian phenotypes, homeostatic regulation of sleep, and cognitive performance in young adults. However, the effects of PER3 genotype on aging-related changes in both cognitive function and cortical integrity remain largely unknown. To shed light into this issue, we have investigated differences in cognitive performance, patterns of cortical thickness, and cortical glucose consumption in normal elderly subjects homozygous carriers of the short (PER34/4, n = 32) and long repeat alleles (PER35/5, n = 32). Relationships between cognitive performance and cortical thickness/metabolism were further explored for each PER3 genotype. We found that PER35/5 carriers had poorer cognitive performance (attention, executive function, semantic memory, and verbal fluency) and lower cortical integrity (structural and functional) than PER34/4. PER35/5 further showed thinning of temporo–parietal areas, and reductions of glucose consumption in fronto–temporo–parietal regions bilaterally. Moreover, PER35/5 subjects exhibited significant correlations between decreased glucose metabolism in fronto–parietal regions and poorer cognitive flexibility, though only correlations with lower glucose consumption of the supramarginal gyrus distinguished PER35/5 from PER34/4 groups.

In agreement with this observation, we report the presence of a protein that specifically binds to the 3′-untranslated region of COXIV mRNA. This factor, that forms with RNA a complex of about 60 kDa, is present both in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where its concentration decreases throughout development with inverse correlation with COXIV accumulation.

We conducted a cross-sectional study with 118 early psychosis individuals, assessing multiple constructs (symptoms, insight, personality traits, alliance, childhood trauma, substance abuse, social functioning and sociodemographics) suggested in the literature as potentially linked to medication adherence or engagement in services. Forward Wald logistic regression suggested that more positive symptoms, having witnessed violence as a child and high agreeableness as a personality trait predicted poor medication adherence. Forward linear regression revealed that physical abuse as a child, lack of knowledge regarding consumer rights, difficulties in building an alliance, low neuroticism and high agreeableness predicted poor service engagement. Profiles of non-adherers or low service engagement were strongly linked to childhood trauma, and high agreeableness, as well as more severe symptoms and poor alliance. Males with histories of legal problems were also more prevalent in both groups. No significant differences were found for insight or substance abuse.

The reprotox QSARs incorporate a weight of evidence paradigm using rats, mice, and rabbit reprotox study data and are designed to identify trans-species reprotoxicants. The majority of the reprotox QSARs exhibit good predictive performance properties: high specificity (>80%), low false positives (<20%), significant receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values (>2.00), and high coverage (>80%) in 10% leave-many-out validation experiments. The QSARs are based on 627–2023 chemicals and exhibited a wide applicability domain for FDA regulated organic chemicals for which they were designed. Experiments were also performed using the MC4PC multiple module prediction technology, and ROC statistics, and adjustments to the ratio of active to inactive (A/I ratio) chemicals in training data sets were made to optimize the predictive performance of QSAR models. Results revealed that an A/I ratio of ∼40% was optimal for MC4PC. We discuss specific recommendations for the application of the reprotox QSAR battery.",

Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are omnipresent and environmental friendly. The renewable emulnergy sources are emerging options to fulfill the energy demand, but unreliable due to the stochastic nature of their occurrence. Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) combines two or more renewable energy sources like wind turbine and solar system.

Cyclic voltammetry data were compared with those obtained for the oxidation of ferrocene (Fc) in EmiTFSI and ACN. The half-potential of FcEmiTFSI/Fc+EmiTFSI is higher than that of Fc/Fc+ in both media. The apparent heterogeneous rate constants k app ° of FcEmiTFSI and Fc were determined in both solvents. The values of k app ° for these two redox probes in the same solvent are of the same order of magnitude. However, k app ° is lower in EmiTFSI than in ACN. Comparison of k app ° in these solvents indicates that the decrease in k app ° cannot be explained in terms of Marcus–Hush theory. The electrochemical and mass-transport properties of FcEmiTFSI in EmiTFSI were investigated by means of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The tip current depends upon the tip velocity. With high tip velocity, one observes that the tip current increases as the distance between the tip and insulating substrate decreases. This behavior is not due to a positive feedback mechanism. It is interpreted in terms of mixed diffusion and convective mass transfer control.",

To perform deeper analysis, additional methods are required such as mouse tracking, which can help researchers understand online user behavior on a single webpage. However, the geometrical data generated by mouse tracking are extremely large, and qualify as big data. A single swipe on a webpage from left to right can generate a megabyte (MB) of data. Fortunately, the geometrical data of each x and y point of the mouse trail are not always needed. Sometimes, analysts only need the heat map of a certain area or perhaps just a summary of the number of activities that occurred on a webpage. Therefore, recording all geometrical data is sometimes unnecessary. This work introduces preprocessing during real-time and online mouse tracking sessions. The preprocessing that is introduced converts the geometrical data from each x and y point to a region-of-interest concentration, in other words only heat map areas that the analyzer is interested in.

DTS employs a fiber optic cable interrogated by laser light, and uses the temperature dependent Raman scattering phenomenon and the speed of light to obtain a discrete spatial measurement of the temperature along the cable. The UAS/DTS combination yielded observations of temperature in the lower atmosphere with high resolution (1 s and 0.1 m) and extent (85 m) that revealed the detailed processes that occurred over a single morning transition. The experimental site was selected on the basis of previous experiments and long term data records; which indicate that diurnal boundary layer development and wind sectors are predictable and consistent. The data showed a complex interplay of motions that occur during the morning transition that resulted in propagation and growth of unstable wave modes. We observed a rapid cooling of the air aloft (layer above the strong vertical temperature gradient) layer directly after sunrise due to vertical mixing followed by an erosion of the strong gradient at the stable layer top. Midway through the transition, unstable wave modes were observed that are consistent with Kelvin–Helmholtz motions. These motions became amplified through the later stages of the transition.",

Being able to be implemented in both fuel cell and electrolyzer modes, the dual electrolyte strategy demonstrates superior peak power density, low overpotentials, high reactivity, and high efficiency. However, keeping the characteristics of laminar flow requires continuous electrolyte flowing in the microchannel. Besides, neutralization reaction would occur within the mixing layer between the catholyte and the anolyte, requiring higher flow rate to control the layer thickness. These lead to considerable electrolyte wastage that will significantly weaken the economical aspect and electrolyte utilization efficiency. To tackle this issue, this study investigated the electrolyte degradation process and proposed an operation scheme for electrolyte recycling. Key parameters of electrolytes were tracked and monitored by mimicking different reactor situations. Results indicated that with appropriately adjusted operating conditions, electrolyte recycling would be feasible in a microfluidic pH-differential network. Accordingly, an pH indicator for electrolyte recycling was proposed for potential practical application.",

Therefore, the costs of hydrogen, hydrogen production quantities using a wind energy conversion system were considered as a case study for 5 different locations of Nigde, Kirsehir, Develi, Sinop and Pinarbasi located in the Central Anatolia in Turkey. Annual wind energy productions and costs for different wind energy conversion systems were calculated for 50m, 80m and 100m hub heights. According to wind energy costs calculations, the amounts and costs of hydrogen production were computed. Furthermore, three different scenarios were taken into account to produce much hydrogen. The results showed that the hydrogen production using a wind energy conversion system with 1300kW rated power had a range from 1665.24kgH2/year in Nigde at 50m hub height to 6288.59kgH2/year in Pinarbasi at 100m hub height.

For large scale and low cost devices, structures with the use of earth abundant materials are attractive. In this study, we fabricated flexible and conductive nanopaper aerogels with incorporated carbon nanotubes (CNT). Such conductive nanopaper is made from aqueous dispersions with dispersed CNT and cellulose nanofibers. Such aerogels are highly porous with open channels that allow the deposition of a thin-layer of silicon through a plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) method. Meanwhile, the open channels also allow for an excellent ion accessibility to the surface of silicon. We demonstrated that such lightweight and flexible Si-conductive nanopaper structure performs well as Li-ion battery anodes. A stable capacity of 1200mAh/g for 100 cycles in half-cells is achieved.

Many of these areas, however, often lack electricity grid supply and as a result installation of energy autonomous T/C stations, usually based on diesel-oil electricity generation, is essential. On the other hand, technological developments and considerable procurement cost reduction of photovoltaics (PVs) encourage also the use of PV stand-alone configurations, as an alternative energy solution for the operation of these remote T/C stations. Instead of using PV-battery configurations alone, contribution of a diesel engine in terms of moderate fuel consumption may downsize the system and improve its economic performance. In this context, an optimum sizing methodology currently developed is used to determine the dimensions of such an autonomous hybrid system, based on the criterion of minimum initial cost. The developed methodology is accordingly applied to a representative Greek area of high solar potential under different scenarios of fuel consumption and panels’ tilt angle. From the results obtained, the proposed hybrid power station appears to be one of the most attractive energy solutions for the support of remote T/C stations, providing increased levels of reliability and presenting low maintenance needs.",

Among them, the autologous is recognized to be the “gold standard” owing to its superior osteogenesis, living tissue with intact cells and conductive scaffold that supports and integrates with the original bone tissue with perfection. Nevertheless, the autologous method is not without its disadvantages. Autologous bone obtained from patients could cause donor site infection, persistent pain and other complications [3]. Without affecting the normal structure and function of donor site, the number of autologous bone is too restricted to meet the demand of clinical treatment [4].

This energy management system is based on a two layer architecture in which the upper layer computes the anticipated end-of-trip DoD using online mass estimation. The lower layer is designed to split the driver power demand by minimizing a cost function which includes the hydrogen/electricity cost ratio. Therefore, the best trade-off between reducing battery pack degradation and using cost effective energy is provided. Furthermore, the system allows the fuel cell to operate at its maximum efficiency.

The artificially introduced oxide coating is believed to make the LiCoO2 electrode more resistant to interfacial side reactions at high voltage and thus minimizes the irreversible loss of the active material upon long cycling. The TiO2 coating layer is also possible to partially react with the decomposition product of electrolyte (e.g. HF) and form a more stable and conductive interphase containing TiF x , which is responsible for the improvement of the rate capability.",
    "output": "The TiO2-coated LiCoO2 electrode shows a good cycling stability and excellent rate capability, making it a promising candidate for high-voltage lithium-ion batteries."

    "input": "Lentil populations were developed from crosses between ‘JL-3’ (sensitive to drought stress) and ‘PDL-1’ and ‘FLIP-96-51’ (tolerant to drought stress), to study the inheritance of drought tolerance and to identify the markers associated with it. The parental types, F1, F2, F3, and backcross (BC) generations were screened for drought tolerance using seedling survivability and drought scores. The F1 hybrids responded similar to the drought-tolerant parent, indicating dominance of seedling drought tolerance over sensitivity. Segregation for seedling survival drought tolerance versus sensitivity in F2 generation was in complete agreement with monogenic 3:1 ratio. The F3 families and backcross data additionally confirmed monogenic tolerance based on seedling survival under drought. Out of 51 SSR markers screened, thirteen markers were polymorphic between the parental types. Seven markers among them were found to be associated with seedling survival drought tolerance through bulk segregant analysis. Association of these markers with seedling survival drought tolerance was further confirmed through their screening on 10 drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive genotypes. These seven markers were screened in F2 mapping population (JL-3 × PDL-1) of 101 individuals to map their position in relation to the gene for seedling survival drought tolerance. Linkage analysis mapped the seven markers within a map distance of 133.2 cM. A single major gene Sdt was identified with a LOD value of 19.9 and phenotypic variation (R2) of 69.7 %. The Sdt locus was obtained in the marker interval of PLC_105–PBA_LC_1480 spanning 24.9 cM with the closest marker PLC_105 at a distance of 9.0 cM on the obtained linkage group. This is the first report on genetic control and linkage of SSR markers for drought tolerance in lentil. These linked markers can be used in molecular breeding programmes for introgression of seedling survival drought tolerance gene in high-yielding cultivars.\r\n",

    "input": "Carbonaceous thin-film electrodes were modified by nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) plasma, and surface-modified carbonaceous thin-film electrodes were obtained and investigated by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). Their chemical composition, degree of fluorination, and chemical bonding were investigated. The effects of surface modification on the anode reaction of lithium-ion batteries were examined. The electrochemical properties of the resultant thin-film electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry using a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The cyclic voltammograms showed that the fluorine atoms on the surface suppressed the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate.",
    "output": "The surface-modified carbonaceous thin-film electrodes exhibited improved electrochemical performance, including higher initial discharge capacity and better cycling stability compared to the unmodified carbonaceous thin-film electrodes. The results suggest that NF3 plasma surface modification is an effective method for improving the electrochemical performance of carbonaceous thin-film electrodes in lithium-ion batteries."
